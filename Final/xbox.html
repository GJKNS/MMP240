<h2>Info</h2>
<p>The Xbox One is a powerful piece of hardware with 8GB RAM DDR3, 64-bit processors and plenty more muscle. But as time passes this hardware will age. As Xbox One Director of development Boyd Multerer pointed out, "You'll still have a limited number of transistors in your house; in your box."</p>

<p>Not much is known about the Xbox One GPU, but a Microsoft representative has told IGN "AMD is our primary partner for the custom silicon that makes up our GPU/CPU SOC that is the heart of Xbox One." [Source: IGN interview with Microsoft]</p>

<p>The Xbox One is built to communicate with servers in the cloud to increase the computational potential of the system. Boyd continued "[As a developer] I can start doing things like shifting latency insensitive things to the cloud. You may have a limited number of transistors in your house, but you have an unlimited number of transistors in the cloud"</p>

<p>As bandwidth improves, there is potential for actual game computations to be off-loaded to servers in the cloud, essentially allowing the Xbox One to become more powerful over time as more and more transistors are connected to Microsoft's cloud infrastructure.</p>
