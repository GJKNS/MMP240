	<li>Before we get to moving, try try putting something on both ends of your board so it wont move forward or backward. Block the movement in a way where you can still lean and turn on the board. This will help with balance and knowing your board'a limit. Every board is different.</li>
	<li>If you did step one correctly and did it for a resonable amount of time, then you know how you want to stand on the board. There are 5 popular positions for standing on a board, this step cannot be taught. Completing step 1 will help you find your most comfortable position. depending on your position, you may lean towards using either feet to kick. Feel out which foot works for you.   </li>
	<li>Kick using the prefered foot. While kicking point your toes parallel to your board at all times. Always practice going up a hill or on a flat surface. </li>
	<li>Stopping is the hardest to learn. The trick is to not stop all at once. Gently place the front of your kicking foot on the ground and gradually apply pressure while bending the knee of your stble leg that on the board to come to a slow stop. Trying to stop at one can damage your knees, and can send you flying at times</li>
